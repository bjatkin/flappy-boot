# Flappy Boot

This is a simple flappy bird clone for the GBA.
You play as hermes boot trying to return to him.
Unfortunately, there seem to be some issues with the tinygo complier that are preventing
this code from compiling as is.
There are likely lots of bugs and some issues with the code, however when running
tinygo build the complier simply hangs providing no feedback.
Unfortunatly, I'm not ready to jump into an obscure fight with the complier right now.
Instead I'm putting this up so it can be referenced and leaving it be for now.
